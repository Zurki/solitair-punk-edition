# 🤘 PUNK-SOLITAIR 🔥

**WARNING:** This repository was created to try out the new Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking model

## 💀 WTF IS THIS?! 💀

Punk-Solitair ain't your grandma's card game! It's a rad, in-your-face twist on the classic time-waster that corporate wage slaves have been playing since Windows 95. Now it's back with an ATTITUDE!

## 🔪 FEATURES 🔪

- 🧠 BRAIN-MELTING gameplay that'll keep you up till 4AM
- 🖤 KILLER aesthetics that would make Sid Vicious proud
- 🔊 SONIC ASSAULT with punk tracks that'll blow your speakers
- 💉 INJECT it straight into your browser - no lame downloads
- 🤬 RAGE-QUIT functionality when the man keeps you down

## 🔌 INSTALLATION 🔌

### THE CONFORMIST WAY (Local Development)

Hack this system by pasting these commands:

```bash
npm install   # conform to the system, man
npm run dev   # stick it to the man
```

Then point your capitalist browser to `http://localhost:5173` and DESTROY THE ESTABLISHMENT!

### THE ANARCHIST WAY (Docker)

Got Docker? SMASH THE SYSTEM with these commands:

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d   # deploy the rebellion

# Or build it yourself
docker build -t punk-solitair .   # package the anarchy
docker run -p 4269:4269 punk-solitair   # unleash chaos
```
Access your containerized REBELLION at `http://localhost:4269`!

Read the even more ass deployment documentation here [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) or don't WE DON'T CARE!

## 🔥 HOW TO PLAY 🔥

1. CLICK stuff until something happens
2. STACK cards in descending order (red on black, black on red)
3. MOVE completed stacks to the foundation piles
4. SMASH your keyboard when you get stuck
5. REPEAT until society crumbles

## 🏴‍☠️ DEPLOY THIS BEAST 🏴‍☠️

```bash
npm run build   # package the rebellion
```

Deploy it to whatever corporate server farm you want. WE DON'T CARE! It's YOUR revolution!

### SERVER DEPLOYMENT

For EXTREME DEPLOYMENTS, we've included Docker and Docker Compose configs:

```bash
# On your server
git clone https://github.com/your-username/punk-solitair.git
cd punk-solitair
docker-compose up -d
```

Check out [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for more HARDCORE deployment options!

## 🚫 RULES ARE FOR SUCKERS 🚫

But if you insist:
- Red cards on black cards, black cards on red cards
- Sequence must be descending (K→Q→J→10→...)
- Foundation piles build up from Ace
- When you win, the system loses
